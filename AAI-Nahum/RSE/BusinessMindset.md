my business would focus on Game dev

my company's core values would be entertainment, innovation, and creativity

and my business/game name would be Intersteller

my game intersteller would make around $197 billion in 2024

3 common business models in my game intersteller that have seen success are DLCs, multiplayer systems, and crafting systems.

The biggest challenges that new businesses face, are being noticed/actually being different and in my case the game would have a massive development scope.

a typical customer would be a person who loves intergalatic travel and aliens, their traits would likely go something like, they love discovery, enjoy long-term progression, they probably seek immersion, and they'd likely enjoy building their character (like their stats mechanics)
