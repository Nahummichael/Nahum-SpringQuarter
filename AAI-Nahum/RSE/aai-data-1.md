1. A business can grow without tracking anything.
technically a business could grow without tracking, although a lot of luck would be involved since usually you'd take into account what would be successful as business and what wouldnt.


2. Follower count is the best way to measure success.
I say that isn't true as a person could have a high follower count but all those people might only be interested in their content but not actually care about them as, i once saw a post about a content creator who had over a thousand followers on sum platform and when they held some kind of event (dont remember what) but no one showed up. all depending on the how success is defined.


3. Customer opinions matter more than sales numbers.
I could agree, as if the customers aren't pleased then the sales will go down, since people won't be purchasing your product/investing in your business.


4. A good decision can be made with no data.
No, since if you dont know what the consequences or what will happen due to the decision (given to you by enough data) then you know what the good choice is


5. Data is always fair.
unless the data is manipulated then it could not be fair, but usually i'd say data is usually fair.
