a game is a way of entertaining one's self via a system that involves players following a set of rules during an artificial conflict, with some kind of end goal.

Game design is creating the rules, systems, mechanics, rewards, challenges and experiences a player will experience during the game.

What is the MDA framework? What are its parts? Define each.
A powerful tool used to understand and analyze game design, the parts consist of Mechanics: the systems and actions the player is able to commit, Dynamics: the actual gameplay that comes from the player's interaction with the game, and Aesthetics: the feeling that the player experiences while playing the game as well as the emotional response to the game's gameplay.

Use the MDA framework to analyze your modified game. Write down your game then fill out these sections: our game was "Cards Against Humanity"

a: All cards placed in response to the black card must NOT be funny
b: Attempting to do the exact opposite of the game's intended purpose was interesting

c: Actively attempting to respond with unfunny cards while having out of pocket cards, usually is funny in its own way due to trying to not be funny usually ends up with a person laughing at their own attempt to be unfunny.
